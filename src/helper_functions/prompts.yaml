    Examples:
    - "unemployment" → ["unemployment rate", "jobless claims", "employment statistics"]
    - "inflation" → ["consumer price index", "price level", "inflation rate"]
    
    Return only the search terms, one per line.

    The user is looking for economic data with this query: "{query}"

    Examples:
    - "job market" → "employment statistics United States"
    - "cost of living" → "consumer price index inflation"
